"""Single per-process dispatcher for all cross-session run triggers.

One asyncio task per process. Subscribes to the shared trigger signal
channel and drains the durable trigger queue on each signal. It is the
**sole** site that spawns :meth:`ChatService.run` into the shared
:class:`ChatRunRegistry`, which is what makes concurrent-spawn races
(two writers contending for one session's run slot → a spurious "already
has an active chat run" 409) structurally impossible: every run trigger
funnels through this one serial consumer.

Each queue entry carries a ``kind`` that selects how a busy session is
handled:

- ``wake`` (idle-session wake-up, ``input_msg=None``): skipped while the
  session is already running — the live run will drain the inbox.
- ``resume`` (a parked HITL run being fed its result): must *not* be
  skipped while running, because the session is typically still running
  the parked tail at trigger time. It is re-queued after a short backoff
  until the parked run releases its session lock, then spawned with the
  carried input event.

All bus keys live on the :class:`MessageBus` base class (see
``enqueue_wakeup`` / ``enqueue_input``, ``dequeue_wakeups``,
``subscribe_wakeup_signal``, ``session_is_running``), so this file has
no hard-coded key strings.
