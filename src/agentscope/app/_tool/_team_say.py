broadcast to all members.

## When to Use This Tool
- Pass **new** requirements or context from the user to a specific member.
- Broadcast an update or coordination message to all members.
- Ask a member a follow-up question when you need clarification.

## When NOT to Use This Tool
- DO NOT repeatedly call this to check on a member's progress — members \
will automatically notify you via ``TeamSay`` when they finish their task. \
Wait for their message instead of polling.
- DO NOT call this right after creating a member by ``AgentCreate``, the \
member will receive its initial task from the ``prompt`` of the \
``AgentCreate`` call and report back when done — just wait for their message. \
- The session is not in a team yet (call ``TeamCreate`` first).
- You want to talk to yourself — use your own reasoning.

## Important
- Each member starts working immediately when created via AgentCreate. \
When a member finishes its task, it will call ``TeamSay`` to report results \
back to you. You do NOT need to prompt them — just wait for their reply.
- **DO NOT** reply to a member's report message unless you have further \
questions or requirements. ``TeamSay`` is for coordination, not chit-chat — \
your top priority is to complete the overall task.
"""

_WORKER_DESCRIPTION = """Send a message to the team leader or broadcast to \
all team members.

## When to Use This Tool
- **IMPORTANT**: When you finish your assigned task, you MUST call this \
tool to report your results back to the leader. The leader is waiting \
for your report — do not end your turn without sending it.
- Share intermediate findings or ask the leader for clarification.
- Broadcast information that other members might need.

## When NOT to Use This Tool
- You want to talk to yourself — use your own reasoning.
- The message is a transient internal thought with no value to others.
