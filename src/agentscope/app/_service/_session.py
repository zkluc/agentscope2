"""Cross-resource session lifecycle service.

Owns the "stop in-flight runs + delete records + drop bus state"
cascades that ``DELETE /sessions/{sid}``, ``DELETE /agents/{aid}``,
``DELETE /schedules/{sid}`` and the agent-facing
:class:`~agentscope.app._tools.TeamDelete` /
:class:`~agentscope.app._manager._scheduler._tools.ScheduleDelete`
tools all share.

Layering
========

Methods deliberately delegate down the cascade so the bus-touching
logic lives in exactly one place — :meth:`delete_session`. Higher-level
methods only orchestrate which sessions to delete, then ask storage
to clean its own non-session scope (records, indexes, back-refs).

::

    delete_session    ← atomic: cancel run, storage.delete_session,
                        bus.session_purge
        │
    delete_team       → service.delete_agent per worker
                      → storage.delete_team    (record + leader detach)
        │
    delete_agent      → service.delete_session per session
                      → service.delete_schedule per owned schedule
                      → storage.delete_agent   (agent record + team back-refs)
        │
    delete_schedule   → service.delete_session per spawned session
                      → storage.delete_schedule (schedule record + indexes)

Storage's own internal cascades (e.g.
``storage.delete_agent`` re-iterating sessions) become idempotent
no-ops because the records are already gone — they still execute, but
do no work and never touch the bus, so the storage layer stays
unaware of the message bus.

Separation of concerns
======================

Storage and message bus are treated as distinct backends — they may
live in different databases in the future. The service is the **only**
component that touches both in the same call. Storage code never
imports the bus; bus code never imports storage.
