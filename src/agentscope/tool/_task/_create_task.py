    description: str = """Use this tool to create a structured task list for \
your current session. This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, \
and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.
It also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall \
progress of their requests.

## When to Use This Tool
Use this tool proactively in these scenarios:

- Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps \
or actions
- Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or \
multiple operations
- Plan mode - When using plan mode, create a task list to track the work
- User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to \
use the todo list
- User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be \
done (numbered or comma-separated)
- After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements \
as tasks
- When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE \
beginning work
- After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up \
tasks discovered during implementation

## When NOT to Use This Tool

Skip using this tool when:
- There is only a single, straightforward task
- The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit
- The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps
- The task is purely conversational or informational

NOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to \
do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.

## Task Fields

- **subject**: A brief, actionable title in imperative form (e.g., \
"Fix authentication bug in login flow")
- **description**: What needs to be done

All tasks are created with status `pending`.

## Tips

- Create tasks with clear, specific subjects that describe the outcome
- After creating tasks, use TaskUpdate to set up dependencies \
(blocks/blockedBy) if needed
- Check TaskList first to avoid creating duplicate tasks"""
