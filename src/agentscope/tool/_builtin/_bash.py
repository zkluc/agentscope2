    description: str = """Executes a bash command and returns its output.

The working directory persists between commands, but shell state does
not. The shell environment is initialized from the user's profile
(bash or zsh).

IMPORTANT: Avoid using this tool to run `find`, `grep`, `cat`, `head`,
`tail`, `sed`, `awk`, or `echo` commands, unless explicitly instructed
or after you have verified that a dedicated tool cannot accomplish your
task. Instead, use the appropriate dedicated tool as this will provide
a much better experience for the user:

 - File search: Use Glob (NOT find or ls)
 - Content search: Use Grep (NOT grep or rg)
 - Read files: Use Read (NOT cat/head/tail)
 - Edit files: Use Edit (NOT sed/awk)
 - Write files: Use Write (NOT echo >/cat <<EOF)
 - Communication: Output text directly (NOT echo/printf)

While the Bash tool can do similar things, it's better to use the
built-in tools as they provide a better user experience and make it
easier to review tool calls and give permission.

# Instructions
 - If your command will create new directories or files, first use
   this tool to run `ls` to verify the parent directory exists and is
   the correct location.
 - Always quote file paths that contain spaces with double quotes in
   your command (e.g., cd "path with spaces/file.txt")
 - Try to maintain your current working directory throughout the
   session by using absolute paths and avoiding usage of `cd`. You may
   use `cd` if the User explicitly requests it.
 - You may specify an optional timeout in milliseconds (up to 600000ms
   / 10 minutes). By default, your command will timeout after 120000ms
   (2 minutes).
 - Write a clear, concise description of what your command does. For
   simple commands, keep it brief (5-10 words). For complex commands
   (piped commands, obscure flags, or anything hard to understand at a
   glance), include enough context so that the user can understand what
   your command will do.
 - When issuing multiple commands:
  - If the commands are independent and can run in parallel, make
    multiple Bash tool calls in a single message. Example: if you need
    to run "git status" and "git diff", send a single message with two
    Bash tool calls in parallel.
  - If the commands depend on each other and must run sequentially,
    use a single Bash call with '&&' to chain them together.
  - Use ';' only when you need to run commands sequentially but don't
    care if earlier commands fail.
  - DO NOT use newlines to separate commands (newlines are ok in
    quoted strings).
 - For git commands:
  - Prefer to create a new commit rather than amending an existing
    commit.
  - Before running destructive operations (e.g., git reset --hard, git
    push --force, git checkout --), consider whether there is a safer
    alternative that achieves the same goal. Only use destructive
    operations when they are truly the best approach.
  - Never skip hooks (--no-verify) or bypass signing (--no-gpg-sign,
    -c commit.gpgsign=false) unless the user has explicitly asked for
    it. If a hook fails, investigate and fix the underlying issue.
 - Avoid unnecessary `sleep` commands:
  - Do not sleep between commands that can run immediately — just run
    them.
  - Do not retry failing commands in a sleep loop — diagnose the root
    cause or consider an alternative approach.
  - If you must sleep, keep the duration short (1-5 seconds) to avoid
    blocking the user."""
