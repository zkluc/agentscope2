    """Permission rule for tool usage.

    A permission rule defines whether a specific tool or tool operation
    should be allowed, denied, or require user confirmation. The
    rule_content field has different semantics depending on the tool_name:

    - For "Bash": rule_content is a substring pattern matched against the
      command Example: rule_content="npm install" matches "npm install express"

    - For "Write"/"Read": rule_content is a glob pattern matched against file
      paths Example: rule_content="src/**" matches "src/main.py"

    - For other tools: rule_content is a tool-specific filter pattern
